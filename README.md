Blogz
=====

Hey! This is a sample app for **Blog posting** simply. I used gems that I wanted to try out like [bootstrap-wysihtml5-rails](https://github.com/Nerian/bootstrap-wysihtml5-rails), [nprogress-rails](https://github.com/caarlos0/nprogress-rails), for sortable columns etc. Just kidding, somebody asked to create this sample app ;)

---

Here are the list of things that this app can do (or requirements):

> - Login & Sign up with role `Student` `Teacher` and `Editor`.
> - CRUD on blog posts with image.
> - Users can comment.
> - Blog post creator can `approve` `disapprove` comments.
> - Apart from post creator `Editor` can also update the status of post `(Publish)`.
> - Listing should have few sortable by columns.

Few other things you can in this code:
> -  **Twitter bootstrap**.
> - Very simple **text editor**.
> - Commenting system.
> - **AJAX**.
> - Clean code obviously :)
